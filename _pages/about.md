I am a Ph.D candidate in [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://www.ust.hk/), advised by [Prof. Kai Chen](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~kaichen/). Before that, I received my B.Eng in Software Engineering in [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) (Outstanding Graduate) in 2020.

<!-- My research interests include system for LLMs, data center networking, congestion control and distributed system.  -->

In my research projects, I focus on:

- developing application-oriented optimizations for distributed systems, including [Herald](https://xudongliao.github.io/assets/pdf/herald-nsdi24.pdf). These systems are designed to enhance performance by leveraging unique application characteristics, such as utilizing embedding access patterns in DLRM training within Herald.
- building performant congestion control (CC) schemes using reinforcement learning techniques, including [Astraea](https://xudongliao.github.io/assets/pdf/astraea-eurosys24.pdf), [Spine](https://xudongliao.github.io/assets/pdf/spine-conext22.pdf), [MOCC](https://xudongliao.github.io/assets/pdf/mocc-eurosys22.pdf) and [Jury](https://xudongliao.github.io/assets/pdf/jury-eurosys25.pdf). These initiatives are driven by my goal to make Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based CC schemes fair, efficient and also practical for real-world deployment.

I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yanjiao Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0020875) during my time at WHU. Additionally, I am fortunate to collaborate closely with [Prof. Guyue Liu](https://grace-liu.github.io) from Peking University and [Dr. Zhizhen Zhong](https://zhizhenzhong.com/) from MIT on several recent projects.
