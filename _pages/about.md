I am a Ph.D candidate in [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://www.ust.hk/), advised by [Prof. Kai Chen](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~kaichen/). Before that, I received my B.Eng in Software Engineering in [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) (Outstanding Graduate) in 2020.

My research interests include system for LLMs, data center networking, congestion control and distributed system.
