I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in February 2025, supervised by [Prof. Kai Chen](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~kaichen/). Before that, I received my B.Eng degree in Computer Science from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2018.
